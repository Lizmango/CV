    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn about distortions in camera, intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of camera etc.\n",
    "- Learn to find these parameters, undistort images etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics\n",

    "- Opencv 3.0 + Python3\n",
    "- checkerboard 7*9\n",

    "### Distortion\n",
    "\n",
    "Pinhole cameras introduce a lot of distortion to images, Two major distortions are radial distortion and tangential distortion.\n",

    "- Radial distortion\n",
    "Radial distortion concludes barrel distortion, pincushion distortion and mustache distortion. Due to radial distortion, straight lines will appear curved as shown below:\n",

    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tangential distortion\n",
    "Tangential distortion occurs because of image takeing lense is not aligned perfectly parallel to the imaging plane. So some areas in image may look nearer than expected. It is solved below:\n",

    "The relationship between pixel plane coordinate and image coordinate is shown as below. Pixel plane and image plane are at the same plane, but there center are different. Besides, the pixel plane measures the length in pixel, while the image coordinate are  measured the length in meters.The coordinates' conversion can be expressed in mathematical formula.\n",
